# Azure Virtual WAN Playground
Welcome to the Azure Virtual WAN Playground repository! Your one-stop shop for an awesome Azure Virtual WAN lab environment.

## What is Azure Virtual WAN Playground?
This repo is dedicated for all poor souls out there who want to play around with Azure Virtual WAN but don't have unlimited Azure Credit in their subscriptions. I've put together a template that deploys Azure Virtual WAN and all resources needed to play around with the service and test everything from VPN, Routing, Secured Virtual Hub, Virtual Network connections and more. The goal is to make it easy to spin up an environment when you need to test a feature for a short period of time and then remove it all when finished.

## How it's built
The Azure Virtual WAN Playground is built using ðŸ’ªBicep language which makes it so much easier to work with and read compared to ARM Templates. Azure Virtual WAN with all it's dependencies between the hub and the connected services like VPN Gateway, Firewall (Secured Virtual WAN), VPN Site makes it hard to follow in pure ARM template. If you haven't tested Bicep yet check out the [Bicep repository](https://github.com/Azure/bicep) for all info needed, I guarantee you're going to love it!

## Deployment
Deploy the solution using the PowerShell `Az` deployment cmdlets or `az cli` deployment commands and the compiled `main.json` template.

## Topology
The Azure Virtual WAN Playground deploys the following topology:

- Azure Virtual WAN
  - Virtual WAN Hub (Secured Virtual Hub)
  - Firewall Policy

## Improvements
Azure Virtual WAN Playground will evolve over time with new features added regularly. The following improvements are planned:

- Will update the Bicep template to use modules
  - With modules in-place multiple sample playgrounds will be available
- User VPN Gateway and User VPN Configuration.
- Azure Firewall Workbook added to Log Analytics Workspace.
- Azure Sentinel.

Other improvements can be requested by creating a new issue.

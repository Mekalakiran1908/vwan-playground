# Azure Virtual WAN Playground
Welcome to the Azure Virtual WAN Playground repository! Your one-stop shop for Azure Virtual WAN lab material.

## What is Azure Virtual WAN Playground?
This repo is dedicated for all poor souls out there who want to play around with Azure Virtual WAN but don't have unlimited Azure Credit in their subscriptions. I've put togehter a template that deploys Azure Virtual WAN and all resources needed to play around with the service and test everything from VPN, User VPN, Routing, Secured Virtual Hub, Virtual Network connections and more. 

## How it's built
The Azure Virtual WAN Playground is built using ðŸ’ªBicep which makes it so much easier to work with and read. Azure Virtual WAN with all it's dependencies betwen the hub and the connected services like VPN Gateways and Firewall (Secured Virtual WAN) makes it hard to follow in pure ARM template. If you haven't tested Bicep yet check out the [Bicep repository](https://github.com/Azure/bicep) for all info needed, I guaratee your'e going to love it!
